# Analysis
This repository contains R Markdown notebooks for techno-economic analysis, summary statistics, plots, and maps of the nonlinear optimization model results. The repository is structured so that each phase is housed in a separate folder:
- techno-economic
- data-visualization
- data

### techno-economic
This folder houses the `social_economic_attributes.Rmd` and `summary_stats.Rmd` notebooks. The `social_economic_attributes.Rmd` notebook obtains social and economic attributes for environmental impact and economic development related to the point coordinates for existing wind projects. The `summary_stats.Rmd` notebook obtains statistics of interest for the social and economic attributes of the existing wind projects.

### data-visualization
This folder houses the `map_plots.Rmd` notebook that includes the code for ths histograms, lollipop plots, and maps of the model results and subsets for reproducibility and later publication.

### data
This folder houses the data referenced in the R Markdown notebooks in the `techno-economic` and `data-visualization` folders.
